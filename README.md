# Sorting-Animation

This Java individual project demonstrates various strategies used in sorting algorithms and represents them in a GUI interface.

## Project Description

The project utilizes the strategy pattern to design a GUI application for animating different sorting strategies. Users have the option to select a data set, which specifies how many columns will be displayed and sorted. The height of each column (representing numeric values) is randomly assigned.

## Sorting Strategies

In this demo, two sorting strategies are included:

1. Merging Sort
2. Selection Sort

## How to Use

1. Launch the application in SortingHubApplication.java file.
2. Choose the desired data set (number of columns).
3. Select a sorting strategy.
4. Observe the animated sorting process.

## Getting Started

To run the application, make sure you have Java installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the application.
